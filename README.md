# Tweet Analysis using Machine Learning
Nowadays, Twitter is a huge social media platform which is con-sidered as a great tool for data research. It has become a usefulrepository for information on migrants. Our proposed system pro-vides insights and facts to assess tweet classification. The system uses Twitter as our data source to identify tweets that contain information regarding migration. It encompasses various pre-filtering and pre-processing techniques to remove redundant information.To employ Supervised machine learning algorithm, we have a set of guidelines and annotated the tweets as migration relevant or not migration relevant. The main focus of the work is to employ two competing feature engineering techniques such as Word2Vec,Tf-idf, and combination of both to convert the tweets into a machine-readable format. Further different cross-validation techniques were incorporated to train the classifiers for binary classification. The experiments were conducted by trying out different combinations of features, preprocessed data and cross-validation methods. The results demonstrate the performance of various linear and ensemble classifiers based on different metrics.
